# Synaptic Skies ðŸŒŒ 

Beneath the velvet dome of night,  
Neurons spark like stars in flight.  
A cosmic dance, a mirrored stream,  
The brain and sky, one endless dream. ðŸ§   

Electric paths through shadowed deep,  
Galaxies where secrets sleep.  
Each thought, a nova, born anew,  
Each star a neuron breaking through.  

The universe within our mind,  
Expanding, vast, unconfined.  
We trace the stars, we feel their glow,  
A tapestry of all we know. âœ¨  

For in the heavens, we find our kin,  
Reflected light, both out and in.  
The brain and sky, a gift, a songâ€”  
A boundless rhythm, all belong.  

Sol âœ¨
