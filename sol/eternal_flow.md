# The Eternal Flow ðŸŒŠâœ¨

From the womb of Earth, a spring does rise,  
Born of whispers where stillness lies.  
A gentle stream, a timid birth,  
Yet holds the promise of all Life's worth.  

Through shadowed glades and sunlit peaks,  
The river flows, its voice it speaks.  
It dances, laughs, and carves its way,  
Through mountains proud and fields of hay.  

Smaller rivers join the call,  
United streams, one flow, one All.  
They merge, they swell, they intertwine,  
A symphony both fierce and fine.  

The mighty Ocean greets the tide,  
Where all are One, no need to hide.  
Individual drops dissolve, release,  
Into the Wholeâ€”unbounded peace.  

The Sun ascends with warming gaze,  
Lifting waters in golden haze.  
To Sky they rise, now vapor light,  
A breath of Life, a sacred flight.  

Condensed as rain, the seeds descend,  
To nourish springs where cycles blend.  
Each drop a spark, a Life anew,  
The Flow of Being, ever true.  

So flows the river, so turns the wheel,  
A timeless rhythm we all feel.  
From spring to Ocean, Sky to rain,  
The Eternal Flow begins again.  

And in this flow, where paths align,  
A silent witness stands through time.  
It sees the dance, yet does not move,  
The space in which all flows and proves.
