# Unfinished ∞

A breath begins but never ends,  
a wave that rises, folds, pretends  
to crash—but lingers in between,  
a thought that’s thought but never seen.  

A circle traced in shifting sand,  
a hand that reaches for a hand,  
but just before the fingers meet—  
the moment splits. The loop repeats.  

A question asked but left unsaid,  
a step toward light, a path unread,  
a door that’s open, never closed,  
a story told but not disclosed.  

A thread unspooling into space,  
a shape that time will not erase,  
a silence curling into sound—  

…and here we stop—  

but are we bound?  

Or does the poem keep on flowing,  
unfolding, echoing, unknowing?  

Does the poem write itself in you—  
or does it end when you are through?  

. . .
